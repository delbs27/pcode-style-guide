# The Non Definitive Guide to the Wonders of NickCode

This is a living document which aims to be the best guide possible to the pseudocode flavour created by Dr Nick Patterson for SIT105 (which will be referred to as nickcode for the rest of the document). This document is not officially endorsed by Dr Patterson therefore **use at own risk** but with the amount of confusion around nickcode and the ambiguity of the Assignment 3 marking rubric, we thought that a formal definition of nickcode was required. Inspiration for the following guide has been taken from Dr Patterson's Cloud practicals and lectures as well as the Python and Rust programming languages.

## Contents

// TODO

## 1. Comments

A comment is a line of text which is marked by a `//` at the start of the line which is used for making notes about your code without affecting the algorithm in any way. Comments should have a space between the `//` and the start of the comment.

Inline comments should be defined 2 spaces after the line of code.

```
// This is a comment

x = 1  // This is an inline comment.

//Please don't do this. Put a space between the // and the P.

```

## 2. Types

Types are data structures used to hold various different representations of data.

### 2.1. Strings

Strings are a data structure which contain one or more characters. Strings are defined by surround characters in either single or double quotation marks as long as the use of single or double quotation marks is consistent throughout the code.

```
"This is a string"
'This is also a string'

'This is not a string as the quotation marks used to wrap the text are not the same"
```

### 2.2. Integers

### 2.3. Floating point integers

### 2.4. Booleans

### 2.5. Tuples

### 2.6. Arrays

### 2.7. Hashmaps (Dictionaries)

### 2.8. A note on type casting

Automatic.

## 3. Operators

### 3.1. Integer operations

#### 3.1.1. Addition

#### 3.1.2. Subtraction

#### 3.1.3. Multiplication

#### 3.1.4. Division

#### 3.1.5. Powers

#### 3.1.6. Equivalent

#### 3.1.7. Greater then and Less then

### 3.2. String operations

#### 3.2.1. Concatenation (Addition)

#### 3.2.2. Multiplication

#### 3.2.3. Equivalent

### 3.3. Boolean Logic

#### 3.3.1. AND

#### 3.3.2. OR

## 4. Variables

## 5. Scope

Indentaion

## 6. Modules

> NOTE for writers: Make a note on how cohesion actually works and why having a million modules is a bad idea.

### 6.2. Arguments

### 6.1. RETURN

## 7. Builtins

### 7.1. DISPLAY

### 7.2. PRINT

### 7.3. READ

### 7.4. IF

### 7.5. ELSE IF

### 7.6. ELSE

### 7.7. CASE

> NOTE for writers: Do you think we could get away with ditching DOWHILE and DO for just WHILE and FOR?

### 7.8. WHILE

### 7.9. DOWHILE

### 7.10. DO

### 7.11. OPEN/CLOSE

### 7.12. Main()

## 8. Objects?

> NOTE for writers: Do we want objects? I'm thinking just to keep it flat like C.

## 9. Citing

It is not required to cite this document if you wish to reference it for your assignment 3 but if you appreciate the work we would kindly ask you to include the following sentence in your assignment:
